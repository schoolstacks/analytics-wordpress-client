== Description ==

Learning Tapestryâ€™s Analytics Engine (AE) provides real-time analytics on how learning content and tools are being used by students.  Our Analytics Engine captures important data such as what content is being viewed, how long is spent on content and if available, data on assessments.  This provides insights to educators to the effectiveness of digital content, so the educator can decide how to best spend time to support individual student personalized learning goals.  As with the Content Discovery Engine, the Analytics Engine is transparently integrated within your existing digital environments, both to gather usage data and display individual and section-level activity in the products they use and have been trained in today.
